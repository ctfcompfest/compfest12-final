Hey Alice, just wanted to warn you that this encryption isn't secure

In fact, not only is this message not secure, EVERY message that is generated after init,
is insecure

Damn backdoors, gotta be careful

Anyways, here's the flag: COMPFEST12{Elliptic_curves_are_just_as_strong_as_the_implementation_94e80df}

Have a nice day Alice :)
